#Tests

**_Test #1_**  
**File(s):** PollGrabber.py  
**Purpose:** Ensure poll data is in Cassandra  
**Details** _(setup, step-by-step explanation so test can be recreated)_:  
1. Manually create Cassandra table on OpenStack  
2. Run PollGrabber.py: `python PollGrabber.py <any topic> <any start date> <any end date>`  
3. Log back into cqlsh, run `SELECT * FROM junk.polls`  
4. See all that wonderful data  
**Pass/Fail?:** PASS

**_Test #2_**  
**File(s):** PollGrabber.py  
**Purpose:** Demonstrate uerying limitations in Cassandra  
**Details** _(setup, step-by-step explanation so test can be recreated)_:   
1. Populate Cassandra database with poll info (in this case in junk.polls)  
2. Log into cqlsh, run `SELECT pollster FROM junk.polls WHERE startDate = '2014-01-10';`  
3. One poll will be returned  
4. run `SELECT name FROM junk.polls WHERE name = 'Obama Job Approval'`  
5. This will throw an error  
**Pass/Fail?:** PASS

**_Test #3_**  
**File(s):** PollGrabber.py  
**Purpose:** Ensure polls are now being ordered by end_date  
**Details** _(setup, step-by-step explanation so test can be recreated)_:   
1. used print statement in a for loop to print all end_date values of self.all_polls  
2. observed in terminal that end_date values were in increasing rder (older polls first)  
**Pass/Fail?:** PASS

**_Test #4_**  
**File(s):** PollGrabber.py  
**Purpose:** Ensure polls are now being ordered by end_date  
**Details** _(setup, step-by-step explanation so test can be recreated)_:   
1. used print statement in a for loop to print all end_date values of self.all_polls  
2. observed in terminal that end_date values were in increasing rder (older polls first)  
**Pass/Fail?:** PASS  
______________________________________________________________________________  
**_Test #5_**  
**File(s):** query.py  
**Purpose:** test if dates are being interpreted correctly  
**Details** _(setup, step-by-step explanation so test can be recreated)_:  
1. ran file with 20160101 and 20160102 as the start/end date arguments  
2. observed that counts were 0, realized incorrect date format was used as input  
**Pass/Fail?:** FAIL

**_Test #6_**  
**File(s):** tweetsBetweenPolls.py  
**Purpose:** functionality test - ran program when it seemed to be finished  
**Details** _(setup, step-by-step explanation so test can be recreated)_:  
1. the two newest polls had the same end date  
2. ran the program, error was thrown because the two dates it checked for tweets between were the same date  
**Pass/Fail?:** FAIL  
______________________________________________________________________________  
**_Test #7_**  
**File(s):** tweetsBetweenPolls.py  
**Purpose:** check if error in previous test was corrected  
**Details** _(setup, step-by-step explanation so test can be recreated)_:  
1. re-wrote program so that if the two newest polls have the same date, an older poll will be used as the starting date  
2. ran the program normally  
**Pass/Fail?:** PASS  
______________________________________________________________________________  
**_Test #8_**  
**File(s):** PollGrabber.py; cassandra database, polls.president table  
**Purpose:** confirming that PollGrabber inserted polls that ended ON the supplied end date  
**Details** _(setup, step-by-step explanation so test can be recreated)_:  
1. ran "SELECT * FROM polls.president WHERE end_date=20160220"  
2. query failed. Tried "SELECT * FROM polls.president WHERE pollster=CNN AND end_date=20160220" in case restricting on the primary key would allow wuery to run  
2. query failed  
**Pass/Fail?:** FAIL  
This requires further testing on how to query on the polls' end dates.

**_Test #9_**  
**File(s):** PollStructureTest.py  
**Purpose:** Try to extract location data from poll API  
**Details** _(setup, step-by-step explanation so test can be recreated)_:  
1. tried specifying a relevant topic and a state in the chart function to see if they returned anything overlapping  
2. all charts returned were distinct even though some returned when specifying the state are relevant to the topic specified in the other call  
3. tried specifying both a state and a topic at the same time  
4. empty set was returned  
**Pass/Fail?:** FAIL
