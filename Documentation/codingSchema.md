#We have decided on the following naming conventions in our code:
#
---
---
#
#Filenames:
##Our files have names where the first word is comprised of only lower case letters, and all subsequent words have their first letter capitalized.
##Ex. ```totalTweetCount.txt```
##Ex. ```text.md```
---
#Classes:
##All of our classes have names that have a capital letter at the beginning of each word.
##Ex. ```SimpleClass(a, b)```
##Ex. ```StreamListener(1, 2, 'Hello World')```
---
#Variables:
##Our variables bear all lower case letters, with an underscore seperating each word.
##Ex. ```sample_variable = 1```
##Ex. ```total_tweet_count = 587```
---
#Functions:
##Our functions have names with the first word starting with a lower case letter, and then all subsequent words begin with a capital letter.
##Ex. ```updateTweetCount(38)```
##Ex. ```shout('hello world')```
