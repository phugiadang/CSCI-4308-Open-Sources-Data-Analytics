- Combine sentiment analysis with regression models to improve quality of predictions
  - use sentiments of tweets each day to weight each day's count, should be able to improve prediction quality
- Use higher order regression models for prediction
  - figure out for each collection of data what order of regression predicts the best - should it be an equation on the order of x^4, or x^6? They produce radically different predictions
