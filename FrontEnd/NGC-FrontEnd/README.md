Basic application demonstrating CEAN (Cassandra, Express, Angular, and Node) Integration with FusionCharts. Application allows users to view analysis pertaining to Democratic and Republican party candidate nominations. Data sources used were Twitter, GDELT, and the Huffington Post API. Each source was tracked by counts and all candidates were compared on a single FusionChart. Then, with all counts discovered on a certain time frame, analysis was done to try and find a correlation between multiple sources.
