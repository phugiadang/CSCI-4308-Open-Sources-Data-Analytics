Correlation Coefficient: 0.279860062609

The correlation between daily tweets and daily articles is slightly positive which is what one would intuitively expect, but in this case the linear regression line and general shape of the data is more interesting. The slope of the regression line is small and reflects that the data is spread out horizontally. This means that regardless of how many articles were written about her each day, there wasn't actually much of a change in how much people were talking about her on Twitter. It's also interesting to note that the yellow dots representing the last 20% of the data (the last few days of the month) have a clear downward slope. So, for these days, there was an inverse correlation between articles written about Hilary and the number of tweets about her.
