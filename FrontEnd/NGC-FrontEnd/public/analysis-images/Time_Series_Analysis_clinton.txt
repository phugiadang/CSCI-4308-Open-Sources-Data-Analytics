TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
Candidate Name: clinton
Data is collected from 2016041100 to 2016041723
A Time Series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties such as mean, variance remain constant over time.
Stationarity is defined using very strict criterion. However, for practical purposes we can assume the series to be stationary if it has constant statistical properties over time, ie. the following:
1.constant mean
2.constant variance
3.an autocovariance that does not depend on time
