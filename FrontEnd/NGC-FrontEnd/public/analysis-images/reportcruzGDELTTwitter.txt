Correlation Coefficient: -0.131008671688

The correlation coefficient is close enough to zero to conclude that there is no significant correlation between the number of articles written about Cruz daily and the nuber of tweets about him each day. This indicates that the linear regression line will be a poor predictor of the observational data, and that is the case - the yellow dots don't follow the regression line. Looking at the flat slope of the line and the shape of the data tells us the same thing, that there isn't much correlation between these two sources of data. The number of daily tweets about Cruz varied moreso than the number of articles, indicating that an increase in interest on Twitter in Cruz on a particular day did not result in an increase of articles about him.
