Correlation Coefficient: -0.588771387118

In what is one of the most bizarre results from the linear regression analysis of our data sources, there is a strong negative correlation between the number of tweets daily about Kasich and his poll numbers. This is the strongest correlation between any of our sources, and the linear regression model was a decent predictor of the last few days of March. Looking at the graph we can see that this trend isn't present in most of the data points, but the six on the rightmost side of the graph, which are days that Kasich had over 100,000 tweets about him, there is a clear downward trend in his poll numbers as the number of tweets goes up. We don't have a strong idea why this correlation exists, and it could explained simply by the fact that there are many, many factors that affect the values coming from both of these sources and the trend we see here could be coincidental.
