Correlation Coefficient: 0.216653298676

There is a slight positive correlation between the daily number of tweets about Kasich and the number of articles written about him. The correlation isn't zero, but it still means that the linear regression model can't be expected to be a great predictor of the observational data. Looking at the data we see that the observational data isn't very far from the regression line, but this is probably mostly to do with the fact that almost all of the data is close to the regression line. Looking at the graph shows quite clearly that despite large fluctuations in the number of articles about Kasich daily, the number of tweets about him rarely exceeds 100,000, only doing so on 6 days of the month. These can probably be attributed to his win in the Ohio primary in the middle of March, though it's interesting that the outliers in the data depart from the norm more significantly in the number of tweets about Kasich than the number of articles. This could mean that people on Twitter were more interested in his Ohio win than the media, assuming that is the source of these outliers.
