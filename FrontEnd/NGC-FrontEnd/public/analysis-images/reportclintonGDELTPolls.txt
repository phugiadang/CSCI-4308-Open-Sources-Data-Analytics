Correlation Coefficient: 0.30480125856

There is a moderate positive correlation between the number of GDELT articles written about Hilary Clinton and her poll numbers. This means that in general there were more articles written about her when her poll numbers were higher and vis versa. This is not a very surprising result; any candidate that wins a primary is going to be in the headlines. What's more surprising is that none of the other candidates have a correlation this positive between articles written daily and poll numbers.
