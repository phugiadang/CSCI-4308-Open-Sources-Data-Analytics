Correlation Coefficient: 0.423022428727

This is the second strongest correlation between any of our sources about a candidate in March. There is a moderate correlation between the number of tweets daily about Trump and his performance in the polls. We would expect that the linear regression model would be a decent predictor of the last few days of the month, but in this case it is not. His poll numbers at the end of the month were much lower than the model expected. The strength of this correlation implies that the same things that spur more conversation about Trump are the same things that help him in the polls. knowing how controversial he is, it is safe to conclude that many of these tweets are not positive, yet there is still a correlation between these sources. When more people are talking about him on Twitter, more people are voting for him.
