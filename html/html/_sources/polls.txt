Our Utilization of the Huffington Post Polster API in gathering poll data
=========================================================================


We wrote a Python program that gathers all of the polls that the API releases.There was no set format of the polls, so we had to write another program that parses each poll, and then converts it into a universal form. Once the poll is in the correct format, it is then stored in our poll table within our database.
