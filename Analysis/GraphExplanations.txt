Linear Regression in General:

Each point represents one day's poll number and tweet or article count.

Finally, the yellow dots are the last 20% of the data chronologically. The closer they are to the red line, the better the linear regression model was at predicting what their values would be. 
We also calculated the correlation between the two variables. The correlation coefficient will always be between 1 and -1. 1 means there is a
